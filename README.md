pyTRUST -- stafur

pyTRUST leverages the utility of a modified version of pycoin to enable the generation of transactions within the TRUSTplus network. To leverage the interface for SQLite, PostgreSQL, and mySQL it is necessary to install:

SQLite: sqlite3 is part of the python standard library.

psycopg: http://initd.org/psycopg/

mysql: http://mysql-python.sourceforge.net/

Testing bitcoin-python and pycoin for alternative methods of communication with the trustplus peer network. 

Using a bitcoin-python derivative allows for faster deployment intefacing with trustplusd. pycoin provides lower level control.
